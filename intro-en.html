<p><b>Technarium</b> is a place with tools for your dreams. We are an open, community-operated space in Vilnius, Lithuania, where people with technology-related interests can collaborate, work on their projects, share their knowledge and skills. We've been operating an informal workspace where our friends and friends of friends could come and make or fix things for several years, we have <a href="projects.html">lots of experience</a> and <a href="equipment.html">the basic equipment</a>. </p>


<p class='normal'>We are creating and developing a local technical community hub guided by the same ethos as <a href="http://hackerspaces.org">the global network of hackerspaces</a> and <a href="http://makezine.com/2013/05/22/the-difference-between-hackerspaces-makerspaces-techshops-and-fablabs/">makerspaces</a>: free and unrestricted sharing of knowledge, active participation and inclusivity. We want to show that technology is an inherently creative endeavour. Join us!</p>


<p class='normal'>
Every month we organise a <b>Hack and Tell</b> event -- a geek party where everyone can present their projects, ask for an advice, meet like-minded people. Follow the events at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/vilnius-hack-and-tell/">Vilnius Hack and Tell Meetup group</a>. A monthly assembly of the collective is on the first Tuesday of the month, at 19:00. We usually discuss current activities, tasks and plans -- drop us a note at <a href="mailto:crew@technarium.lt">crew(a)technarium.lt</a> or just come by.
