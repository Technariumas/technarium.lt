<h3>Join Technarium!</h3>


<p><b>Technarium</b> is an independent hackerspace/workshop based in Vilnius, Lithuania. We are a non-commercial community initiative sustained by membership fees we use to cover the rent and other expenses.

<p>
We are a community, not landlords. The community and people with their ideas make this place come alive and are more important than finance. If you cannot afford full membership but would like to make something useful or interesting for everybody, let's talk. We shall never close the door to good initiatives because of money.
