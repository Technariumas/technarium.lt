<h3>Join Technarium!</h3>


<p><b>Technarium</b> is an independent hackerspace/workshop based in Vilnius, Lithuania. We are a non-commercial community initiative sustained by membership fees we use to cover the rent and other expenses.
</p>

<p>If you would like to become a member, <a href="mailto:crew@technariumas.lt">contact</a> us: we'll show you around on Monday nights (18:00-21:00). In order to accomodate all different needs and abilities, we offer the following membership levels starting on January 2020:</p>



<table id="membership">
	<tr>
    <th>0. Visitor/starving hacker membership -- 16€/month.</th>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>A special case: for those who just hang out here occasionally or who are away at the moment but do not wish to cancel their membership. Also for those who like the idea of an open community working space and would like to support us. Visitor members are welcome when other members are at the space. They can use the common area, kitchen and wireless Internet access.</td>

<p>
We are a community, not landlords. The community and people with their ideas make this place come alive and are more important than finance. If you cannot afford full membership but would like to make something useful or interesting for everybody, let's talk. We shall never close the door to good initiatives because of money.
