<h3>Join Technarium!</h3>


<p><b>Technarium</b> is an independent hackerspace/workshop based in Vilnius, Lithuania. We are a non-commercial community initiative sustained by membership fees we use to cover the rent and other expenses.
</p>

<p>If you would like to become a member, <a href="mailto:crew@technariumas.lt">contact</a> us: we'll show you around. In order to accomodate all different needs and abilities, we offer the following membership levels starting on June 2016:</p>

<table id="membership">
	<tr>
    <th>0. Visitor/starving hacker membership -- 10€/month.</th>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>For those who just hand out here occasionally or who cannot afford the standard membership at a given moment. Also for those who like the idea of an open community working space and would like to support us. Visitor members do not have the keys to Technarium and are welcome when other members are at the space. They can also use some hand-held tools, the common area, kitchen and wireless Internet access.</td>

<p>
We are a community, not landlords. The community and people with their ideas make this place come alive and are more important than finance. If you cannot afford full membership but would like to make something useful or interesting for everybody, let's talk. We shall never close the door to good initiatives because of money.
